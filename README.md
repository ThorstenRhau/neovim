# My neovim configuration

This setup is "by me for me", intended for my personal use.

In case you want to use my setup for learning or something else I have written some documentation
that should help you to get started.

Since 2023-12-24 I consider this repo as stable. It should be safe to clone it and stay on the main
branch. There will be changes but all changes will be documented and I hope that no breaking changes
slip through the cracks.

2024 Christmas update: I have been using this configuration as my daily driver for a year now. It
has evolved quite a bit since the start.

If you want to make this configuration your own, just clone it and remove the _.git_ directory from
the root folder.

## Installation

### Optional plugins

Before I maintained two configurations. One light weight and one fully featured. They have now been
merged in to this configuration.

The default is lightweight, to enable LSP, linting, formatting, and all the other plugins that are
found in **lua/optional** you only need to set the environment variable **NVIM_OPTIONAL_PLUGINS** to
**1**

Example for fish shell

```fish
set -gx NVIM_OPTIONAL_PLUGINS 1
```

Example for zsh and bash

```sh
export NVIM_OPTIONAL_PLUGINS=1
```

### Dependencies

I use macOS so here are the instructions for how to install dependencies with homebrew on a mac.

```sh
brew install ripgrep fd cmake git node wget shellcheck python3 \
selene hg nvim lazygit imagemagick
```

```sh
npm install -g neovim
npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli
```

### Cloning the repository

When you have all the dependencies installed, clone the repo in to _~/.config/nvim/_

Example:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ThorstenRhau/neovim.git ~/.config/nvim
```

### First launch

When you launch neovim for the first time after cloning the repository you will see a lot going on.
Plugins should be installed by Lazy and Treesitter should install language parsers. Thereafter you
can run **_:MasonToolsInstall_** to install all LSPs, Linters, and Formatters for this
configuration. When this is done it is a good idea to quit or re-start neovim.

### Verify your installation

Launch neovim and run _:Lazy load all_ to load all the plugins. After you have loaded all the
plugins you can run _:checkhealth_ to see that everything is configured and working properly before
you start to use neovim for your editing.

## Thank you

There are many individuals and projects that I have learned and taken inspiration from. Thank you to
all of you üôè.
